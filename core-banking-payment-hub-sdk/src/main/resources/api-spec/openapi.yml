        **Simulates a UK Faster Payment without actual execution.**

        This endpoint performs validation and preliminary checks without moving any funds:

        - Validates the payment request data including sort code and account number
        - Performs sort code validation against the UK payments directory
        - Checks for sufficient funds (without placing a hold)
        - Calculates any applicable fees
        - Determines if Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is required
        - Delivers SCA code if required (via SMS or other configured channel)
        - Returns estimated processing time (typically seconds or minutes for FPS)

        **Important:** Use this endpoint before executing a payment to verify it will succeed
        and to obtain a simulation reference that must be included in the execute request.

        **Cancels an existing UK Faster Payment with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) support.**

        This endpoint attempts to cancel a previously submitted payment:

        - Validates the cancellation request
        - Verifies the payment exists and is in a cancellable state
        - Verifies SCA if required (using the code delivered during cancellation simulation)
        - Attempts to cancel the payment with the Faster Payments network
        - Returns the cancellation status and any applicable fees

        **Important Limitations:**
        - Faster Payments can only be cancelled if they haven't been settled yet
        - Due to the near real-time nature of the service, the cancellation window may be very short
        - Once settled, a return payment must be initiated instead
        - A simulation reference from the `/fps/cancel/simulate` endpoint must be included for SCA verification

      summary: Schedule a UK BACS Payment
      description: |+
        **Schedules a UK BACS Payment for future execution on the specified date.**

        This endpoint creates a scheduled payment instruction:

        - Validates the payment request data including sort code and account number
        - Verifies the execution date is valid (must be a future business day)
        - Verifies SCA if required (using the code delivered during simulation)
        - Creates a scheduled payment instruction
        - Supports optional recurrence patterns for recurring payments

        **Important Notes:**
        - The payment will be automatically submitted to the BACS network on the specified date
        - Funds are not reserved until the actual execution date
        - The actual settlement will occur 2 business days after the execution date due to the BACS processing cycle
        - BACS only processes payments on business days
        - Payments scheduled for weekends or holidays will be processed on the next business day

      summary: Execute a UK BACS Payment
      description: |+
        **Executes a UK BACS Payment through the BACS network.**

        This endpoint processes the actual payment transaction:

        - Validates the payment request data including sort code and account number
        - Verifies sufficient funds are available
        - Places a hold on the funds
        - Verifies SCA if required (using the code delivered during simulation)
        - Submits the payment to the BACS network
        - Returns a transaction reference and expected settlement date

        **Settlement Time:** BACS payments follow a 3-day processing cycle:
        - Submit on day 1
        - Process on day 2
        - Complete on day 3

        **Common Uses:**
        - Salary and wage payments
        - Direct Debits for regular bills
        - Supplier payments
        - Regular business-to-business transfers

        **Required Fields:**
        - `simulationReference`: Reference from a previous successful simulation call
        - `sca.authenticationCode`: If SCA was required during simulation

      description: |+
        **Cancels an existing UK BACS Payment with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) support.**

        This endpoint attempts to cancel a previously submitted payment:

        - Validates the cancellation request
        - Verifies the payment exists and is in a cancellable state
        - Verifies SCA if required (using the code delivered during cancellation simulation)
        - Attempts to cancel the payment with the BACS network
        - Returns the cancellation status and any applicable fees

        **Important Limitations:**
        - BACS payments can typically be cancelled up until the end of the submission day (day 1 of the 3-day cycle)
        - Once the payment has moved to processing (day 2), cancellation is no longer possible
        - A simulation reference from the `/bacs/cancel/simulate` endpoint must be included for SCA verification

        **Schedules a SEPA payment for future execution on the specified date.**

        This endpoint creates a scheduled payment instruction:

        - Validates the payment request data including IBAN and BIC
        - Verifies the execution date is valid (must be a future date for SCT, or a valid collection date for SDD)
        - Verifies SCA if required (using the code delivered during simulation)
        - Creates a scheduled payment instruction
        - Supports optional recurrence patterns for recurring payments

        **Important Notes:**
        - The payment will be automatically submitted to the SEPA network on the specified date
        - Funds are not reserved until the actual execution date
        - For SEPA Direct Debits, specific rules apply regarding advance notification and mandate validation
        - Recurrence patterns use standard CRON expressions to define repeating schedules

        This endpoint is used to trigger SCA delivery and provide information about cancellation:

        - Validates the cancellation request
        - Checks if the payment exists and is in a cancellable state
        - Determines if Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is required for cancellation
        - Delivers SCA code if required (via SMS or other configured channel)
        - Returns information about cancellation feasibility, fees, and SCA requirements

        **Important Notes:**
        - The simulation reference returned must be included in the actual cancellation request
        - This endpoint does not actually cancel the payment
        - For SEPA Instant Credit Transfers, the cancellation window is very short due to real-time settlement
        - For SEPA Direct Debits, specific rules apply for cancellation before the collection date

      summary: Simulate a TIPS payment
      description: |+
        **Simulates a TIPS payment without actual execution.**

        The simulation process:

        - Validates the payment request data including IBAN and BIC
        - Verifies the receiving bank is a TIPS participant
        - Checks for sufficient funds (without placing a hold)
        - Verifies the payment amount is within TIPS limits (currently â¬100,000)
        - Calculates any applicable fees
        - Determines if Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is required
        - Delivers SCA code if required (via SMS or other configured channel)

        **About TIPS:**
        - TIPS (TARGET Instant Payment Settlement) is an instant payment service available 24/7/365
        - Settles payments in central bank money in seconds
        - Designed for retail payments requiring immediate settlement

        **Important:**
        - Use this endpoint before executing a payment to verify it will succeed
        - The simulation reference must be included in the execute request if SCA is required

        **Important Notes:**
        - The payment will be automatically submitted to the TIPS network on the specified date
        - Funds are not reserved until the actual execution date
        - Since TIPS operates 24/7/365, payments can be scheduled for any date
