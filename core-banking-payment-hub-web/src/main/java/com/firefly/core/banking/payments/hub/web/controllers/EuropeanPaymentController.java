/**
 * REST controller for European payment operations.
 * Exposes endpoints for simulating, executing, cancelling, and scheduling European payments
 * through the three main European payment schemes: TARGET2, TIPS, and EBA STEP2.
 *
 * European Payment Schemes:
 *
 * 1. TARGET2 (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer):
 *    - Real-time gross settlement system for euro payments
 *    - Used for high-value, time-critical payments between financial institutions
 *    - Settles in central bank money with immediate finality
 *    - Operates during business hours on TARGET2 business days
 *
 * 2. TIPS (TARGET Instant Payment Settlement):
 *    - Instant payment service available 24/7/365
 *    - Settles payments in central bank money in seconds
 *    - Maximum amount per transaction is currently â‚¬100,000
 *    - Designed for retail payments requiring immediate settlement
 *
 * 3. EBA STEP2 (European Banking Association STEP2):
 *    - Pan-European Automated Clearing House for bulk euro payments
 *    - Processes both SEPA Credit Transfers and SEPA Direct Debits
 *    - Operates on a batch processing model with multiple daily cycles
 *    - Typically settles within 1 business day

               This endpoint creates a scheduled payment instruction:

               - Validates the payment request data including IBAN and BIC
               - Verifies the execution date is valid (must be a future business day)
               - Verifies SCA if required

               - Supports optional recurrence patterns for recurring payments

               **Important Notes:**
               - The payment will be automatically submitted to the EBA STEP2 network on the specified date
               - Funds are not reserved until the actual execution date
               - EBA STEP2 only processes payments on business days
               - Payments scheduled for weekends or holidays will be processed on the next business day
