/**
 * REST controller for SEPA payment operations.
 * Exposes endpoints for simulating, executing, cancelling, and scheduling SEPA payments.
 *
 * SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a payment integration initiative of the European Union for
 * simplifying bank transfers denominated in euro. SEPA enables customers to make cashless euro payments
 * to anyone located within the SEPA area using a single bank account and a single set of payment instruments.
 *
 * SEPA payment types include:
 *
 * 1. SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT):
 *    - Standard euro transfers within the SEPA zone
 *    - Typically settles within 1 business day
 *    - Maximum amount is typically unlimited
 *    - Used for regular business and personal transfers
 *
 * 2. SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst):
 *    - Real-time euro transfers available 24/7/365
 *    - Settles within 10 seconds
 *    - Maximum amount currently â‚¬100,000
 *    - Used for urgent transfers requiring immediate settlement
 *
 * 3. SEPA Direct Debit (SDD):
 *    - Pre-authorized pull payments from a debtor's account
 *    - Requires a mandate from the debtor
 *    - Available in Core (consumer) and B2B (business) schemes
 *    - Used for recurring payments and one-off collections
 *
 * SEPA covers all EU member states plus additional European countries and territories.

               - Returns estimated settlement date based on the SEPA scheme (standard or instant)

               **Important:** Use this endpoint before executing a payment to verify it will succeed
